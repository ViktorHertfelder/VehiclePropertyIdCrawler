# VehiclePropertyId crawler

This is a simple crawler that pulls the VehiclePropertyIds and their corresponding values from https://developer.android.com/reference/android/car/VehiclePropertyIds#constants_1 .
If there are any changes on said page, you just have to run the crawler and the .csv-File will be up to date.

## Mapping looks like this:

ABS_ACTIVE,287310858
